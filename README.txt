Phase polynomials synthesis algorithm based on the paper [Phase polynomials synthesis algorithms for NISQ architectures and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00934).

### Installation
The numpy and networkx packages are required
```
pip install numpy networkx
```

To run the code, execute the following command
```
